# Mobile Test

A coding test.

## Some important notes to consider before running the project

1- I used Clean Archeticture bind with GetX State management in order to improve code quality but keep in mind that i used GetX for RoutManagement and StateManagement ONLY
cause I didn't have time to learn about all the features that the package gives so I used my OWN Core and I know that the app is over-engineered but I like to make my codebase healthy and Strong as a stronghold
and testable in the first place ^_^

2- The Code Is 90% Clean except some constant values in the layout part

3- I used Code Generation so make sure to run
"flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs" without the double quotes in the terminal to generate dependencies

4- I used GOOGLE Fonts (Alexandaria) and you can find it in the theme manager in the resources

5- I used flutter localizations because i had experience dealing with it but i didn't localize the app because you didn't demand it : ) and i sort of run out on time learning getx

6- I changed the app icon and lable and the App BuildGradle signing config

# It was a nice and joyful experience Thank You so much ^_^
